Configuration of the IAG VVT
----------------------------

This is the configuration for the Vacuum Vertical Telescope (VVT) at the Institute for Astrophysics and Geophysics in
GÃ¶ttingen. See `here <https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/217813.html>`_ for more details.

All the configs are shown here without the ``comm`` part and the environment details.

acquisition
"""""""""""
Module for performing a fine-acquisition on the sun

.. code-block:: YAML
  :linenos:

  class: pyobs.modules.pointing.Acquisition

  # modules
  telescope: solartelescope
  camera: suncamera

  # loging

    roots:
      cache:
        class: pyobs.vfs.HttpFile
        download: http://localhost:37075/

* The :class:`~pyobs.modules.pointing.Acquisition` class is used for the acquisition module (line 1).
* It requires the name of the other modules to use, which are :ref:`solartelescope` for the telescope and
  :ref:`suncamera` for the camera (lines 4-5).
* A log file where all the offsets from the acquisitions are stored, can be useful for checking the pointing model
  (line 8).
* The (initial) exposure time for the camera (line 11).
* Tolerances for the acquisiton: It succeeds if the telescope is closer than 10" to the target position on the sun.
  It fails if the offsets get larger than 7200". 10 moves are allowed (lines 14-16).
* The pipeline defines steps performed on the images in order to get the offsets for the next step (lines 18-20):

  #. ``DiskOffset`` is a custom class that takes the WCS from the :ref:`suncamera` and calculates offsets to go
     to the requested position.
  #. ``SunExpTimeEstimator`` is a custom class that tries to estimate a best exposure time for the next image.

* The offsets are applied via ``ApplySiderostatOffsets``, a custom class for offsetting the :ref:`solartelescope`
  (lines 22-23).
* Finally, a VFS is defined with a root ``cache`` that points to the :ref:`filecache` HTTP cache server
  and is used for downloading the images from the :ref:`suncamera` (lines 25-30).
