# Fleet open items: open issues and plans across the pyobs fleet

Status: standing snapshot — checked on 2026-08-24.

Fleet-wide view of what's open across the pyobs project fleet (see
`specs/steering/pyobs-project-tiers.md` for the fleet definition). This is a **derived view**, not
a source of truth:

- **Open issues**: GitHub is authoritative — re-query with `gh issue list --repo pyobs/<repo>
  --state open`.
- **Open plans**: each repo's own `specs/plans/index.md` (or `specs/index.md` for repos that keep
  their plans there) is authoritative; this doc links the docs and copies their one-line status.

**Maintenance rule: update this file whenever you open/close an issue or change a plan's status —
and remove closed items outright, never annotate them.** Only open items live here.

Repos: the whole pyobs fleet.

## Open issues (2, checked 2026-08-24)

One row per issue — same layout for every repo.

| Repo | # | Title | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| pyobs-core | [#739](https://github.com/pyobs/pyobs-core/issues/739) | Record installed pyobs package versions in FITS headers | *enhancement* — per-package version keywords; approach undecided |
| pyobs-weather | [#6](https://github.com/pyobs/pyobs-weather/issues/6) | Historic data | *enhancement* |

## Open plans

### pyobs-core `specs/plans/`

- [2026-07-27-gui-widget-plugins-and-packaging.md](../plans/2026-07-27-gui-widget-plugins-and-packaging.md) —
  *draft* (pyobs-gui). Widget plugin mechanism + `pyside6-deploy` packaging; loading mechanism
  decided + spiked, widget-selection mechanism still open.
- [2026-07-29-gui-telescopewidget-layout.md](../plans/2026-07-29-gui-telescopewidget-layout.md) —
  *proposed* (pyobs-gui). `TelescopeWidget` width-floor investigation with candidate fixes.
- [2026-08-23-iag50-pyobs-core-2x-migration.md](../plans/2026-08-23-iag50-pyobs-core-2x-migration.md) —
  *in progress* (pyobs-iag50, IAG-internal). `1.x` branch cut, `develop` reset to
  `2.0.0.dev0`/`pyobs-core>=2.0.0.dev93`; actual code migration (grid-API rewrite, `self.proxy()`
  async-context-manager change, missing-await fixes) not yet done, three open questions need
  Tim's input.

### Design docs still *proposed*

- [gui-standalone-binary.md](../design/gui-standalone-binary.md) — umbrella for the compiled
  pyobs-gui binary; login pieces done, widget plugin/selection + real plugin smoke test still open.

### Sibling repos

One line per plan — same layout for every repo.

- **pyobs-web-client** — [acl-aware-shell-forms](../../pyobs-web-client/specs/plans/acl-aware-shell-forms.md) —
  ACL-aware Shell forms (*proposed*)
- **pyobs-web-client** — [auxiliary-interface-widgets](../../pyobs-web-client/specs/plans/auxiliary-interface-widgets.md) —
  auxiliary interface widgets (attach-or-standalone) (*proposed*)
- **pyobs-web-client** — [idatasequence](../../pyobs-web-client/specs/plans/idatasequence.md) —
  `IDataSequence` support ("grab N images") (*proposed*)
- **pyobs-web-client** — [rpc-fault-call-id](../../pyobs-web-client/specs/plans/rpc-fault-call-id.md) —
  surface `call_id` on RPC faults (*proposed*)
- **pyobs-web-client** — [struct-typed-command-params](../../pyobs-web-client/specs/plans/struct-typed-command-params.md) —
  `struct<Name>`-typed command params (*blocked on upstream*)
- **pyobs-web-client** — [telescope-page](../../pyobs-web-client/specs/plans/telescope-page.md) —
  telescope page for `ITelescope` modules (*proposed*)
- **pyobs-web-client** — [vfs-token-auth](../../pyobs-web-client/specs/plans/vfs-token-auth.md) —
  VFS endpoint auth (Basic Auth → Bearer token) (*proposed*)

## Open decisions

- **ADR 0013** (rename pyobs-robotic-backend → `pyobs-schedule`) — *proposed*: `pyobs-schedule` is
  the recommendation, pending team confirmation; the rename itself (repo/package/Docker
  image/Keycloak client, in lockstep) has not been executed. See
  [0013-renaming-pyobs-robotic-backend.md](../adrs/0013-renaming-pyobs-robotic-backend.md).
